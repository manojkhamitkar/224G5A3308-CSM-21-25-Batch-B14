# Attendance-Monitoring

The integrated face detection and time-stamped attendance monitoring system uses 
computer vision and machine learning to automate attendance marking through facial 
recognition, improving accuracy, efficiency, and security. The system consists of four 
components: face detection to identify and locate faces, face recognition to match 
detected faces with stored images, a database to store face embeddings and attendance 
records, and a user interface for interaction and management. Implementation involves 
setting up the system with necessary software (Python, OpenCV, dlib/face recognition, 
SQLite/MySQL, Flask/Django) and hardware (webcam, computer), detecting faces 
using OpenCV or dlib, recognizing faces by comparing video feed embeddings with 
stored ones, integrating a database for record management, and developing a web 
interface for managing attendance records and settings. This comprehensive approach 
streamlines attendance tracking and enhances usability through an integrated web 
interface.
